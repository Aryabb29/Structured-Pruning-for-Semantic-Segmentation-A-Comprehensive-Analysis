This project investigates the application of structured pruning techniques to enhance the efficiency of real-time semantic segmentation models crucial for computer vision applications. This project investigates the application of structured pruning techniques to enhance the efficiency of realtime semantic segmentation models crucial for computer vision applications. Employing popular architectures such as ICNet and BiSeNetV2, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of structured pruning on model accuracy, inference speed, and parameter reduction. Our research explores the tradeoff between model compression and task-specific performance, considering various pruning ratios and strategies. The findings provide valuable insights into the feasibility and efficacy of structured pruning for optimizing neural networks, offering a roadmap for deploying efficient semantic segmentation models in resource-constrained environments within the evolving landscape of machine learning.
